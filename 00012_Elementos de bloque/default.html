  Luke? Luke? Luke? Have you seen Luke this morning? He
  said he had some things to do before he started today, 
  so he left early. Uh? Did he take those two new droids 
  with him? I think so. Well, he'd better have those units
  in the south range repaired be midday or there'll be
  hell to pay! Wait, there's something dead ahead on the
  scanner. It looks like our droid...hit the accelerator.
